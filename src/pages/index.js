                <p>
                    For our first-ever release, we wanted to recreate scenes from books that have left a profound impact on us.
                    We examined Maan and Firoz's queerplatonic friendship in <em>A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth</em>,
                    David and Giovanni's hot and cold relationship in the quintessential book <em>Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin</em>,
                    <em> Samra Habib's We Have Always Been Here: A Queer Muslim Memoir</em> ‚Äî a story about immigrants and
                    <em> Alok Vaid-Menon's Beyond the Gender Binary</em>. Our primary focus has been on rewriting the narrative.
                    Here, we have attempted to amplify the voices of queer South Asian people which are often silenced by
                    white, cis-heteronormative stories within the mainstream. We want our community to feel seen.
                    <em> Representation is important.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of hard work has gone into bringing our first release to life. Special thanks to
                    Zelina for photographing and interviewing our community, Sohini for bringing our ideas to life
                    and Shradha for their creative styling! We appreciate and thank you for your support. This would have
                    been impossible without the involvement of the Toronto artists you see on-screen and folks who helped
                    us behind the scenes. Cheers and ‡§∂‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ! ‚ú®
